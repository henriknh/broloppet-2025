# Broloppet bot

When you are too tired to refresh yourself

## How it works

The bot will look for a `Purchase` button. If not found it will proceed and press the button in the next step and play a sound and then pause. If no `Purchase` button is found it will refresh and retry.

> Note: There is a captcha that you need to manually click from time to time

## Setup

```
npm i
```

## Run

```
npm run start
```

## Disclaimer

This is of course only for fun :)
